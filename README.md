# gdocs
It creates random google docs links and sees if you can access it

I havent actually seen it actually return a public doc yet, but it theoretically should if the doc link is correct

Unless theres some glaring errors that I don't see

# what it does

1. Generates a random google doc link
2. Sends a get request
3. If the get request is successful, then the program should (theoretically) open up a public doc- otherwise it repeats these steps

*There is a 2-3 minute wait inbetween each get request- to make sure that google doesnt find me and hunt me down*
